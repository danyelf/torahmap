// The dictionary seam.
//
// Search asks this module two questions: what could a written form be, and
// which verses carry a given set of meanings. ETCBC answers them today; the
// interface is deliberately narrow so another dictionary could.
//
// The seam exists for a specific reason. A `LexemeId` is a position in the
// dictionary array loaded at startup, so every value shifts if the index is
// regenerated. It is a fine in-memory handle and a terrible thing to write into
// a URL. Outside this module a meaning is identified by its `key`, which is
// ETCBC's own identifier paired with its language — `<LH/@heb`. The language is
// not decoration: 461 ETCBC ids are shared by a Hebrew word and an Aramaic one,
// and `<LH/` is both burnt-offering and pretext.
